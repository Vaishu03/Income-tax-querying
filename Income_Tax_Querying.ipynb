In general, it\\nfollows the pattern of the United States model tax convention but differs in a number of respects to\\nreflect India\\'s status as a developing country.\\n\\n      The Convention provides maximum rates of tax at source on payments of dividends, interest and\\nroyalties which, in each case, are higher than the rates specified in the United States Model. Dividends\\nfrom a subsidiary to a parent corporation are taxable at a maximum rate of 15 percent; other dividends\\nmay be taxable at source at a 25 percent rate. Interest is, in general, taxable at source at a maximum\\nrate of 15 percent, although interest received by a financial institution is taxable at a maximum rate of 10\\n\\n\\x0cpercent, and interest received by either of the two Governments, by certain governmental financial\\ninstitutions, and by residents of a Contracting State on certain Government approved loans, is exempt\\nfrom tax at source.\\n\\n      The royalty provisions contain several significant departures from standard United States tax treaty\\npolicy. In general, industrial and copyright royalties are taxable at source at a maximum rate of 20\\npercent for the first five years, dropping to 15 percent thereafter. Where the payor of the royalty is one\\nof the Governments, a political subdivision or a public sector corporation, tax will be imposed from the\\ndate of entry into force of the treaty at a maximum rate of 15 percent. Payments for the use of, or the\\nright to use, industrial, commercial or scientific equipment are treated as royalties, rather than as\\nbusiness profits, and are subject to a maximum rate of tax at source of 10 percent. The most significant\\ndeparture from past policy in the royalty article is the fact that certain service fees, referred to in the\\nConvention as \"fees for included services\", are treated in the same manner as royalties, and not, as\\nwould normally be the case, as business profits. Included services are defined as technical consultancy\\nservices which either: (i) are ancillary and subsidiary to the licensing of an intangible or the rental of\\ntangible personal property, both of which give rise to royalty payments, or, (ii) if not ancillary or\\nsubsidiary, make available to the payor of the service fee some technical knowledge, experience, skill,\\netc., or transfer to that person a technical plan or design. A detailed memorandum of understanding was\\ndeveloped by the negotiators to provide guidance as to the intended scope of the concept of “included\\nservices” and the effect of the memorandum is agreed to in an exchange of notes. These are included for\\ninformation only. Fees for all other services are treated either as business profits or as independent\\npersonal services income. Although not reflected in the convention, under Indian law, certain  service\\nfees related to defense contracts are exempt from Indian tax..\\n\\n      The Convention preserves for the United States the right to impose the branch profits tax. It\\npreserves for both Contracting States their statutory taxing rights with respect to capital gains.\\n\\n      The Convention also contains rules for the taxation of business profits which, consistent with other\\nUnited States tax treaties with developing countries, provide a broader range of circumstances under\\nwhich one partner may tax the business profits of a resident of the other. The Convention defines\\npermanent establishment to include a construction site or a drilling rig where the site or activity continues\\nfor a period of 120 days in a year. This compares with a twelve month threshold under the United\\nStates Model, and six months under the typical developing country tax treaty. In addition, the\\nConvention contains reciprocal exemption at source for shipping and aircraft operating income, including\\nincome from the incidental leasing of ships, aircraft or containers (i.e., where the lessor is an operator of\\nships and aircraft). The Convention differs from the United States Model in that income from the non-\\nincidental leasing of ships, aircraft or containers (i.e., where the lessor is not an operator of ships or\\naircraft) is not covered by the article. Income from such non-incidental leasing is treated as a royalty,\\ntaxable at source at a maximum rate of 10 percent.\\n\\n      The treatment under the Convention of various classes of personal service income is similar to that\\nunder the United States tax treaties with developing countries.\\n\\n\\x0c      The Convention contains provisions designed to prevent third-country residents from treaty\\nshopping, i.e., from taking unwarranted advantage of the Convention by routing income from one\\nContracting State through an entity created in the other. These provisions consistent with recent tax\\nlegislation, identify treaty shopping in terms both of third-country ownership of an entity, and of the\\nsubstantial use of the entity\\'s income to meet liabilities to third-country persons. Notwithstanding the\\npresence of these factors, however, treaty benefits will be allowed if the income is incidental to or\\nearned in connection with the active conduct of a trade or business in the State of residence, if the\\nshares of the company earning the income are traded on a recognized stock exchange, or if the\\ncompetent authority of the source State so determines.\\n\\n      As with all United States tax treaties, the Convention prohibits tax discrimination, creates a dispute\\nresolution mechanism and provides for the exchange of otherwise confidential tax information between\\nthe tax authorities of the parties. The Convention authorizes access by the General Accounting Office\\nand the tax writing committees of Congress to certain information exchanged under the Convention\\nwhich is relevant to the functions of these bodies in overseeing the administration of United States laws.\\n\\n      In an exchange of notes, the United States and India agree that, although the Convention does not\\ncontain a tax sparing credit, if United States policy changes in this regard, the Convention will be\\npromptly amended to incorporate a tax sparing provision. These notes are also included for information\\nonly.\\n\\n      A technical memorandum explaining in detail the provisions of the Convention and the related\\nProtocol is being prepared by the Department of the Treasury and will be submitted separately to the\\nSenate Committee on Foreign Relations.\\n\\n      The Department of the Treasury, with the cooperation of the Department of State, was primarily\\nresponsible for the negotiation of the Convention and related Protocol.\\n\\n      Respectfully submitted,\\n\\nEnclosures: As stated.\\n\\nJAMES A. BAKER III.\\n\\nLETTER OF TRANSMITTAL\\n\\nTHE WHITE HOUSE, October 31, 1989.\\n\\nTo the Senate of the United States:\\n\\n      I transmit herewith for Senate advice and consent to ratification the Convention between the\\nGovernment of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of India for the\\nAvoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income,\\n\\n\\x0ctogether with a related Protocol, signed at New Delhi on September 12, 1989. I also transmit the report\\nof the Department of State on the convention.\\n\\n      The convention would be the first tax treaty between the United States and India. It includes special\\nprovisions that take into account India\\'s status as a developing nation and that reflect changes in U.S.\\ntax treaty policy resulting from the Tax Reform Act of 1986.\\n\\n      Of particular importance are the provisions limiting the withholding tax rates on various categories of\\ninvestment income, as well as those designed to prevent third-country residents from taking unwarranted\\nadvantage of the convention by routing income from one Contracting State through an entity created in\\nthe other. The convention also provides for the exchange of information by the competent authorities of\\nthe Contracting States.\\n\\n      I recommend the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the convention, together with a\\nrelated protocol, and give its advice and consent to ratification.\\n\\nGEORGE BUSH.\\n\\nCONVENTION BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF\\nAMERICA AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF INDIA FOR THE\\nAVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION AND THE PREVENTION OF FISCAL EVASION\\nWITH RESPECT TO TAXES ON INCOME\\n\\n      The Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of India,\\ndesiring to conclude a Convention for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal\\nevasion with respect to taxes on income, have agreed as follows:\\n\\nARTICLE 1\\nGeneral Scope\\n\\n      1.

Notwithstanding any provision of the Convention except paragraph 4, a Contracting State may\\ntax its residents (as determined under Article 4 (Residence)), and by reason of citizenship may tax its\\ncitizens, as if the Convention had not come into effect. For this purpose, the term “citizen” shall include a\\n\\n\\x0cformer citizen whose loss of citizenship had as one of its principal purposes the avoidance of tax, but\\nonly for a period of 10 years following such loss.\\n\\n      4. The provisions of paragraph 3 shall not affect\\n\\n(a) the benefits conferred by a Contracting State under paragraph 2 of Article 9\\n(Associated Enterprises), under paragraphs 2 and 6 of Article 20 (Private Pensions, Annuities,\\nAlimony, and Child Support), and under Articles 25 (Relief from Double Taxation), 26 (Non-\\ndiscrimination), and 27 (Mutual Agreement Procedure); and\\n\\n(b) the benefits conferred by a Contracting State under Articles 19 (Remuneration and\\n\\nPensions in Respect of Government Service), 21 (Payments Received by Students and\\nApprentices), 22 (Payments Received by Professors, Teachers and Research Scholars) and 29\\n(Diplomatic Agents and Consul Officers), upon individuals who are neither citizens of, nor have\\nimmigrant status in, that State.\\n\\nARTICLE 2\\nTaxes Covered\\n\\n      1.

The Convention shall apply also to any identical or substantially similar taxes which are imposed\\nafter the date of signature of the Convention in addition to, or in place of, the existing taxes. The\\ncompetent authorities of the Contracting States shall notify each other of any significant changes which\\nhave been made in their respective taxation laws and of any official published material concerning the\\napplication of the Convention.\\n\\nARTICLE 3\\nGeneral Definitions\\n\\n\\x0c      1.

Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, the term “permanent establishment” shall\\nbe deemed not to include any one or more of the following:\\n\\n(a) the use of facilities solely for the purpose of storage, display, or occasional delivery\\n\\nof goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise;\\n\\n(b) the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise\\n\\nsolely for the purpose of storage, display, or occasional delivery;\\n\\n(c) the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise\\n\\nsolely for the purpose of processing by another enterprise;\\n\\n(d) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of purchasing\\n\\ngoods or merchandise, or of collecting information, for the enterprise;\\n\\n(e) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of advertising, for\\nthe supply of information, for scientific research or for other activities which have a preparatory\\nor auxiliary character, for the enterprise.\\n\\n      4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, where a person - other than an agent of\\nan independent status to whom paragraph 5 applies - is acting in a Contracting State on behalf of an\\nenterprise of the other Contracting State, that enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent\\nestablishment in the first-mentioned State if:\\n\\n\\x0c(a) he has an habitually exercises in the first-mentioned State an authority to conclude\\n\\ncontracts on behalf of the enterprise, unless his activities are limited to those mentioned in\\nparagraph 3 which, if exercised through a fixed place of business, would not make that fixed\\nplace of business a permanent establishment under the provisions of that paragraph;\\n\\n(b) he has no such authority but habitually maintains in the first-mentioned State a stock\\n\\nof goods or merchandise from which he regularly delivers goods or merchandise on behalf of\\nthe enterprise, and some additional activities conducted in that State on behalf of the enterprise\\nhave contributed to the sale of the goods or merchandise; or\\n\\n(c) he habitually secures orders in the first-mentioned State, wholly or almost wholly for\\n\\nthe enterprise.\\n\\n      5.

However, when the activities of such an agent are\\ndevoted wholly or almost wholly on behalf of that enterprise and the transactions between the agent and\\nthe enterprise are not made under arm\\'s-length conditions, he shall not be considered an agent of\\nindependent status within the meaning of this paragraph.\\n\\n      6. The fact that a company which is a resident of a Contracting State controls or is controlled by a\\ncompany which is a resident of the other Contracting State, or which carries on business in that other\\nState (whether through a permanent establishment or otherwise), shall not of itself constitute either\\ncompany a permanent establishment of the other.\\n\\nARTICLE 6\\nIncome from Immovable Property (Real Property)\\n\\n      1. Income derived by a resident of a Contracting State from immovable property (real property),\\nincluding income from agriculture or forestry, situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that\\nother State.\\n\\n      2. The term “immovable property” shall have the meaning which it has under the law of the\\nContracting State in which the property in question is situated.\\n\\n      3. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall also apply to income derived from the direct use, letting, or\\nuse in any other form of immovable property.\\n\\n      4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 3 shall also apply to the income from immovable property of\\nan enterprise and to income from immovable property used for the performance of independent\\npersonal services.\\n\\n\\x0cARTICLE 7\\nBusiness Profits\\n\\n      1. The profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the\\nenterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated\\ntherein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in\\nthe other State but only so much of them as is attributable to\\n\\n(a) that permanent establishment;\\n(b) sales in the other State of goods or merchandise of the same or similar kind as those\\n\\nsold through that permanent establishment; or\\n\\n(c) other business activities carried on in the other State of the same or similar kind as\\n\\nthose effected through that permanent establishment.\\n\\n      2. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on\\nbusiness in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in\\neach Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be\\nexpected to make if it were a distinct and independent enterprise engaged in the same or similar\\nactivities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly at arm\\'s-length with the enterprise of\\nwhich it is a permanent establishment and other enterprises controlling, controlled by or subject to the\\nsame common control as that enterprise. In any case where the correct amount of profits attributable to\\na permanent establishment is incapable of determination or the determination thereof presents\\nexceptional difficulties, the profits attributable to the permanent establishment may be estimated on a\\nreasonable basis. The estimate adopted shall, however, be such that the result shall be in accordance\\nwith the principles contained in this Article.\\n\\n      3.

If information is requested by a Contracting State in accordance with this Article, the other\\nContracting State shall obtain the information to which the request relates in the same manner and in the\\nsame form as if the tax of the first-mentioned State were the tax of that other State and were being\\nimposed by that other State. If specifically requested by the competent authority of a Contracting State,\\nthe competent authority of the other Contracting State shall provide information under this Article in the\\nform of depositions of witnesses and authenticated copies of unedited original documents (including\\nbooks, papers, statements, records, accounts, and writings), to the same extent such depositions and\\ndocuments can be obtained under the laws and administrative practices of that other State with respect\\nto its own taxes.\\n\\n      5.

It also provides examples of services intended to\\nbe covered within the definition of included services and those intended to be excluded, either because\\nthey do not satisfy the tests of paragraph 4, or because, notwithstanding the fact that they meet the tests\\nof paragraph 4, they are dealt with under paragraph 5. The examples in either case are not intended as\\nan exhaustive list but rather as illustrating a few typical cases. For ease of understanding, the examples in\\nthis memorandum describe U.S. persons providing services to Indian persons, but the rules of Article\\n12 are reciprocal in application.\\n\\n      Article 12 includes only certain technical and consultancy services. By technical services, we mean\\nin this context services requiring expertise in a technology. By consultancy services, we mean m this\\ncontext advisory services. The categories of technical and consultancy services are to some extent\\n\\n\\x0coverlapping because a consultancy service could also be a technical service. However, the category of\\nconsultancy services also includes an advisory service, whether or not expertise in a technology is\\nrequired to perform it.\\n\\n      Under paragraph 4 technical and consultancy services are considered included services only to the\\nfollowing extent: (1) as described in paragraph 4(a), if they are ancillary and subsidiary to the application\\nor enjoyment of a right, property or information for which a royalty payment is made; or (2) as\\ndescribed in paragraph 4(b), if they make available technical knowledge, experience, skill, know-how,\\nor processes, or consist of the development and transfer of a technical plan or technical design. Thus,\\nunder paragraph 4(b), consultancy services which are not of a technical nature cannot be included\\nservices.\\n\\nParagraph 4(a)\\n\\n      Paragraph 4(a) of Article 12 refers to technical or consultancy services that are ancillary and\\nsubsidiary to the application or enjoyment of any right, property, or information for which a payment\\ndescribed in paragraph 3(a) or (b) is received. Thus, paragraph 4(a) includes technical and consultancy\\nservices that are ancillary and subsidiary to the application or enjoyment of an intangible for which a\\nroyalty is received under a license or sale as described in paragraph 3(a), as well as those ancillary and\\nsubsidiary to the application or enjoyment of industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment for which a\\nroyalty is received under a lease as described in paragraph 3(1)).\\n\\n      It is understood that, in order for a service fee to be considered \"ancillary and subsidiary\" to the\\napplication or enjoyment of some right, property, or information for which a payment described in\\nparagraph 3(a) or (b) is received, the service must be related to the application or enjoyment of the\\nright, property, or information. In addition, the clearly predominant purpose of the arrangement under\\nwhich the payment of the service fee and such other payment are made must be the application or\\nenjoyment of the right, property, or information described in paragraph 3. The question of whether the\\nservice is related to the application or enjoyment of the right, property, or information described in\\nparagraph 3 and whether the clearly predominant purpose of the arrangement is such application or\\nenjoyment must be determined by reference to\\nthe facts and circumstances of each case. Factors which may be relevant to such determination\\n(although not necessarily controlling) include:\\n\\n1. the extent to which the services in question facilitate the effective application or\\n\\nenjoyment of the right, property, or information described in paragraph 3;\\n\\n2. the extent to which such services are customarily provided in the ordinary course of\\n\\nbusiness arrangements involving royalties described in paragraph 3;\\n\\n3. whether the amount paid for the services (or which would be paid by parties\\noperating at arm\\'s length) is an insubstantial portion of the combined payments for the services\\nand the right, property, or information described in paragraph 3;\\n\\n4. whether the payment made for the services and the royalty described in paragraph 3\\n\\nare made under a single contract (or a set of related contracts); and\\n\\n\\x0c5. whether the person performing the services is the same person as, or a related person\\n\\nto, the person receiving the royalties described in paragraph 3 (for this purpose, persons are\\nconsidered related if their relationship is described in Article 9 (Associated Enterprises) or if the\\nperson providing the service is doing so in connection with an overall arrangement which\\nincludes the payor and recipient of the royalties).\\n\\n      To the extent that services are not considered ancillary and subsidiary to the application or\\nenjoyment of some right, property, or information for which a royalty payment under paragraph 3 is\\nmade, such services shall be considered \"included services\" only to the extent that they are described in\\nparagraph 4(b).\\n\\nFacts:\\n\\nAnalysis:\\n\\nFacts:\\n\\nExample (1)\\n\\nA U.S. manufacturer grants rights to an Indian company to use manufacturing processes\\nin which the transferor has exclusive rights by virtue of process patents or the protection\\notherwise extended by law to the owner of a process. As part of the contractual\\narrangement, the U.S. manufacturer agrees to provide certain consultancy services to\\nthe Indian company in order to improve the effectiveness of the latter\\'s use of the\\nprocess. Such services include, for example, the provision of information and advice on\\nsources of supply for materials needed in the manufacturing process, and on the\\ndevelopment of sales and service literature for the manufactured product. The payments\\nallocable to such services do not form a substantial part of the total consideration\\npayable under the contractual arrangement. Are the payments for these services fees for\\n\"included services\"?\\n\\nThe payments are fees for included services. The services described in this example are\\nancillary and subsidiary to the use of a manufacturing process protected by law as\\ndescribed in paragraph 3(a) of Article 12 because the services are related to the\\napplication or enjoyment of the intangible and the granting of the right to use the\\nintangible is the clearly predominant purpose of the arrangement. Because the services\\nare ancillary and subsidiary to the use of the manufacturing process, the fees for these\\nservices are considered fees for included services under paragraph 4(a) of Article 12,\\nregardless of whether the services are described in paragraph 4(b).\\n\\nExample (2)\\n\\nAn Indian manufacturing company produces a product that must be manufactured under\\nsterile conditions using machinery that must be kept completely free of bacterial or other\\nharmful deposits. A U.S. company has developed a special cleaning process for\\nremoving such deposits from that type of machinery. The U.S. company enters into a\\ncontract with the Indian company under which the former will clean the latter\\'s\\nmachinery on a regular basis. As part of the arrangement, the U.S. company leases to\\nthe Indian company a piece of equipment which allows the Indian company to measure\\n\\n\\x0cthe level of bacterial deposits on its machinery in order for it to know when cleaning is\\nrequired. Are the payments for the services fees for included services?\\n\\nAnalysis: \\n\\nIn this example, the provision of cleaning services by the U. S. company and the rental\\nof the monitoring equipment are related to each other. However, the clearly\\npredominant purpose of the arrangement is the provision of cleaning services. Thus,\\nalthough the cleaning services might be considered technical services, they are not\\n\\'ancillary and subsidiary\" to the rental of the monitoring equipment. Accordingly, the\\ncleaning services are not \"included services\" within the meaning of paragraph 4(a).\\n\\nParagraph 4(b)\\n\\n      Paragraph 4(b) of Article 12 refers to technical or consultancy services that make available to the\\nperson acquiring the service technical knowledge, experience, skill, know-how, or processes, or consist\\nof the development and transfer of a technical plan or technical design to such person. (For this\\npurpose, the person acquiring the service shall be deemed to include an agent, nominee, or transferee of\\nsuch person.) This category is narrower than the category described in paragraph 4(a) because it\\nexcludes any service that does not make technology available to the person acquiring the service.\\nGenerally speaking, technology will be considered \"made available\" when the person acquiring the\\nservice is enabled to apply the technology. The fact that the provision of the service may require\\ntechnical input by the person providing the service does not per se mean that technical knowledge,\\nskills, etc. are made available to the person purchasing the service, within the meaning of paragraph\\n4(b). Similarly, the use of a product which embodies technology shall not per se he considered to make\\nthe technology available.\\n\\n      Typical categories of services that generally involve either the development and transfer of technical\\nplans or technical designs, or making technology available as described in paragraph 4(b), include:\\n\\n1. engineering services (including the subcategories of bioengineering and aeronautical,\\n\\nagricultural, ceramics, chemical, civil, electrical, mechanical, metallurgical, and industrial\\nengineering);\\n\\n2. architectural services; and\\n3. computer software development.\\n\\n      Under paragraph 4(b), technical and consultancy services could make technology available in a\\nvariety of settings, activities and industries. Such services may, for example, relate to any of the\\nfollowing areas:\\n\\n1. bio-technical services;\\n2. food processing;\\n3. environmental and ecological services;\\n4. communication through satellite or otherwise;\\n5. energy conservation;\\n6. exploration or exploitation of mineral oil or natural gas;\\n\\n\\x0c7. geological surveys;\\n8. scientific services; and\\n9. technical training.\\n\\n      The following examples indicate the scope of the conditions in paragraph 4(b):\\n\\nExample (3)\\n\\nFacts: \\n\\nA U.S. manufacturer has experience in the use of a process for manufacturing wallboard\\nfor interior walls of houses which is more durable than the standard products of its type.\\nAn Indian builder wishes to produce this product for its own use. It rents a plant and\\ncontracts with the U.S. company to send experts to India to show engineers in the\\nIndian company how to produce the extra strong wallboard. The U.S. contractors work\\nwith the technicians in the Indian firm for a few months. Are the payments to the U.S.\\nfirm considered to be payments for \"included services\"?\\n\\nAnalysis: \\n\\nThe payments would be fees for included services. The services are of a technical or\\nconsultancy nature; in the example, they have elements of both types of services. The\\nservices make available to the Indian company technical knowledge, skill, and\\nprocesses.\\n\\nFacts: \\n\\nAnalysis: \\n\\nFacts: \\n\\nExample (4)\\n\\nA U.S. manufacturer operates a wallboard fabrication plant outside India. An Indian\\nbuilder hires the U.S. company to produce wallboard at that plant for a fee. The Indian\\ncompany provides the raw materials, and the U.S. manufacturer fabricates the\\nwallboard in its plant, using advanced technology. Are the fees in this example for\\nincluded services?\\n\\nThe fees would not be for included services. Although the U.S. company is clearly\\nperforming a technical service, no technical knowledge, skill, etc., are made available to\\nthe Indian company, nor is there any development and transfer of a technical plan or\\ndesign. The U.S. company is merely performing a contract manufacturing service.\\n\\nExample (5)\\n\\nAn Indian firm owns inventory control software for use in its chain of retail outlets\\nthroughout India. It expands its sales operation by employing a team of traveling\\nsalesmen to travel around the countryside selling the company\\'s wares. The company\\nwants to modify its software to permit the salesmen to access the company\\'s central\\ncomputers for information on what products are available in inventory and when they\\ncan be delivered. The Indian firm hires a U.S. computer programming firm to modify its\\n\\n\\x0csoftware for this purpose. Are the fees which the Indian firm pays treated as fees for\\nincluded services?\\n\\nAnalysis: \\n\\nThe fees are for included services. The U.S. company clearly performs a technical\\nservice for the Indian company, and it transfers to the Indian company the technical plan\\n(i.e., the computer program) which it has developed.\\n\\nExample (6)\\n\\nFacts: \\n\\nAn Indian vegetable oil manufacturing company wants to produce a cholesterol-free oil\\nfrom a plant which produces oil normally containing cholesterol. An American company\\nhas developed a process for refining the cholesterol out of the oil. The Indian company\\ncontracts with the U.S. company to modify the formulas which it uses so as to eliminate\\nthe cholesterol, and to train the employees of the Indian company in applying the new\\nformulas. Are the fees paid by the Indian company for included services?\\n\\nAnalysis: \\n\\nThe fees are for included services. The services are technical, and the technical\\nknowledge is made available to the Indian company.\\n\\nExample (7)\\n\\nThe Indian vegetable oil manufacturing firm has mastered the science of producing\\ncholesterol-free oil and wishes to market the product world-wide. It hires an American\\nmarketing consulting firm to do a computer simulation of the world market for such oil\\nand to advise it on marketing strategies. Are the fees paid to the U.S. company for\\nincluded services?\\n\\nThe fees would not be for included services. The American company is providing a\\nconsultancy service which involves the use of substantial technical skill and expertise. It\\nis not, however, making available to the Indian company any technical experience,\\nknowledge or skill, etc., nor is it transferring a technical plan or design. What is\\ntransferred to the Indian company through the service contract is commercial\\ninformation. The fact that technical skills were required by the performer of the service\\nin order to perform the commercial information service does not make the service a\\ntechnical service within the meaning of paragraph 4(b).\\n\\nFacts: \\n\\nAnalysis: \\n\\nParagraph 5\\n\\n      Paragraph 5 of Article 12 describes several categories of services which are not intended to be\\ntreated as included services even if they satisfy the tests of paragraph 4. Set forth below are examples of\\ncases where fees would be included under paragraph 4, but are excluded because of the conditions of\\nparagraph 5.\\n\\n\\x0cExample (8)\\n\\nFacts: \\n\\nAn Indian company purchases a computer from a U.S. computer manufacturer. As part\\nof the purchase agreement, the manufacturer agrees to assist the Indian company in\\nsetting up the computer and installing the operating system, and to ensure that the staff\\nof the Indian company is able to operate the computer. Also, as part of the purchase\\nagreement, the seller agrees to provide, for a period of ten years, any updates to the\\noperating system and any training necessary to apply the update. Both of these service\\nelements to the contract would qualify under paragraph 4(b) as an included service.\\nWould either or both be excluded from the category of included services, under\\nparagraph 5(a), because they are ancillary and subsidiary, as well as inextricably and\\nessentially linked, to the sale of the computer?\\n\\nAnalysis: \\n\\nThe installation assistance and initial training are ancillary and subsidiary to the sale of\\nthe computer, and they are also inextricably and essentially linked to the sale. The\\ncomputer would be of little value to the Indian purchaser without these services, which\\nare most readily and usefully provided by the seller. The fees for installation assistance\\nand initial training, therefore, are not fees for included services, since these services are\\nnot the predominant purpose of the arrangement.\\n\\nThe services of updating the operating system and providing associated necessary training may well be\\nancillary and subsidiary to the sale of the computer, but they are not inextricably and essentially linked to\\nthe sale. Without the upgrades, the computer will continue to operate as it did when purchased, and will\\ncontinue to accomplish the same functions. Acquiring the updates cannot, therefore, be said to be\\ninextricably and essentially linked to the sale of the computer.\\n\\nFacts: \\n\\nExample (9)\\n\\nAn Indian hospital purchases an X-ray machine from a U.S. manufacturer. As part of\\nthe purchase agreement, the manufacturer agrees to install the machine, to perform an\\ninitial inspection of the machine in India, to train hospital staff in the use of the machine,\\nand to service the machine periodically during the usual warranty period (2 years).\\nUnder an optional service contract purchased by the hospital, the manufacturer also\\nagrees to perform certain other services throughout the life of the machine, including\\nperiodic inspections and repair services, advising the hospital about developments in X-\\nray film or techniques which could improve the effectiveness of the machine, and training\\nhospital staff in the application of those new developments. The cost of the initial\\ninstallation, inspection, training, and warranty service is relatively minor as compared\\nwith the cost of the X-ray machine. Is any of the service described here ancillary and\\nsubsidiary, as well as inextricably and essentially linked, to the sale of the X-ray\\nmachine?\\n\\n\\x0cAnalysis: \\n\\nThe initial installation, inspection, and training services in India and the periodic service\\nduring the warranty period are ancillary and subsidiary, as well as inextricably and\\nessentially linked, to the sale of the X-ray machine because the usefulness of the\\nmachine to the hospital depends on this service, the manufacturer has full responsibility\\nduring this period, and the cost of the services is a relatively minor component of the\\ncontract. Therefore, under paragraph 5(a) these fees are not fees for included services,\\nregardless of whether they otherwise would fall within paragraph 4(b).\\n\\n      Neither the post-warranty period inspection and repair services, nor the advisory and training\\nservices relating to new developments are \"inextricably and essentially linked\" to the initial purchase of\\nthe X-ray machine. Accordingly, fees for these services may be treated as fees for included services if\\nthey meet the tests of paragraph 4(b).\\n\\nExample (10)\\n\\nFacts: \\n\\nAn Indian automobile manufacturer decides to expand into the manufacture of\\nhelicopters. It sends a group of engineers from its design staff to a course of study\\nconducted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for two years to study\\naeronautical engineering. The Indian firm pays tuition fees to MIT on behalf of the firm\\'s\\nemployees. Is the tuition fee a fee for an included service within the meaning of Article\\n12?\\n\\nAnalysis: \\n\\nThe tuition fee is clearly intended to acquire a technical service for the firm. However,\\nthe fee paid is for teaching by an educational institution, and is, therefore, under\\nparagraph 5(c), not an included service. It is irrelevant for this purpose whether MIT\\nconducts the course on its campus or at some other location.\\n\\nExample (11)\\n\\nFacts: \\n\\nAs in Example (10), the automobile manufacturer wishes to expand into the manufacture\\nof helicopters. It approaches an Indian university about establishing a course of study in\\naeronautical engineering. The university contracts with a U.S. helicopter manufacturer to\\nsend an engineer to be a visiting professor of aeronautical engineering on its faculty for a\\nyear. Are the amounts paid by the university for these teaching services fees for included\\nservices?\\n\\nAnalysis: \\n\\nThe fees are for teaching in an educational institution. As such, pursuant to paragraph\\n5(c), they are not fees for included services.\\n\\nExample (12)\\n\\nFacts: \\n\\nAn Indian wishes to install a computerized system in his home to control lighting, heating\\nand air conditioning, a stereo sound system and a burglar and fire alarm system. He\\n\\n\\x0chires an American electrical engineering firm to design the necessary wiring system,\\nadapt standard software, and provide instructions for installation. Are the fees paid to\\nthe American firm by the Indian individual fees for included services?\\n\\nAnalysis:\\n\\nThe services in respect of which the fees are paid are of the type which would generally\\nbe treated as fees for included services under paragraph 4(1)). However, because the\\nservices are for the personal use of the individual making the payment, under paragraph\\n5(d) the payments would not be fees for included services.\\n\\n\\x0c', metadata={'source': '/content/india.pdf'})]"
